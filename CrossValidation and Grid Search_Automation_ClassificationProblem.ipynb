    "    Please find below a summary of the overall approach.\n",
    "    1. Chi-square test was performed to sigle out of the feature importance of the catagorical feature and it was concluded \n",
    "        that All catagorical features seems to have some kind of influence on the outcome.\n",
    "    2. Following Features have been decided to be removed from model building and training as part of initial phase.\n",
    "        -- Cabin : because most of the values (Aprox 70%) are missing\n",
    "        -- Names:\n",
    "        -- Ticket\n",
    "    3. Model Accuracy has been tested with Cross validations score using following models.\n",
    "          1.Decesion Trees Classifier\n",
    "          2.RandomForest Classifier\n",

    "          7.XGBoost Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "    4. Based on 10 Crosss validation splits, it is found that the XGBoost Random Forest Classifier gave the better accuracy \n",
    "       score of Min Score of:75%, Maximum Score of:90% and Average Score of: 83%\n",
    "    5. K-Fold Crosss validation was performed and extracted the best training and Testing sample out of 10 splits and \n",
    "       model was retrained.\n",
    "    6. GridSearch Hyperparametr tuning approach was also tried to check if the model performance can further be increased.\n",
